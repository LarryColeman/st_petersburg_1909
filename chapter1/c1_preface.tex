\chapter{Preface}

This is a book in which analysis is accurate. 

The games in this book show the working of the mind of the master, and the commentary has been intended to guide the thought of him who plays over these games so that he may perceive weakness and merit. Notes have been made solely for that purpose. The glossary was meant to be both necessary and sufficient. Nowhere will it be found lacking in supplying explanation needed, but it has no superfluities.

The work has been translated from German, all but the early part, by Mr.~R.~Teichmann, and some valuable advice has been given to me by Mr.~Teichmann, for which I beg to thank him here.
